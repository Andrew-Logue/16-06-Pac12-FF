Application Name: Pac-12 Fantasy Football

Application Description: Our applicaiton will take in data from the ESPN API, and display player names, statistics, and team name. The user will be able to create their own team via a draft function. The user will also be able to bet on their team through our app, using real world betting splits.

Our application will be a fantasy football application for the Pac-12 Conference. Users will be able to draft teams and monitor the progress of their team throughout the season. Data will be pulled from a college football api. We envision a league feature which allows you to compete against your friends. We are also considering betting features using a make believe virtual currency. 

Using our application would follow this procedure. Upon loading the homepage, the user will be able to see relevant player stats, top fantasy teams, and possibly links to video highlights of recent games. They will have the option to sign in. Once signed in, users will have access to the draft feature. Using this, they can create a team composed of their favorite players. They will also have the option to create or join a league. Leagues will be comprised of multiple users and will have restrictions on teams based on the idea that a player can appear in a league only once. The goal is to have users matched up every week with another user and be given points based on how their players perform. The user with the most ammount of points that week would win. We plan on allotting each user a set ammount of virtual currency at the creation of their account. This currency can be used to bet on your team in an individual week or your performance in the league.  

Vision Statement: For college football enthusiasts, who want to draft a fantasy football team in the Pac-12 conference, with a sports betting function. The Pac-12 Fantasy Football applicaiton is a fantasy sports app that allows you to restict your draft to the Pac-12 conference, and place bets on your team's performance each week. Unlike ESPN Fantasy Football, our product is soley for Pac-12 enthusiasts.
